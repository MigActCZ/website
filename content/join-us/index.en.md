At MigAct, we believe that meaningful change starts with connection. Whether you want to volunteer, collaborate, or simply show up and take part — there’s a place for you in our community.

## Join as a Volunteer
Become part of our growing network of active residents helping to make Prague more inclusive.
Volunteers help us organize community gatherings, support during events, take photos, facilitate workshops, translate materials, or contribute as experts in their field.

Your time and skills can make a real difference — and you’ll meet great people along the way. Get in touch to learn more about current opportunities.

## Come to Our Events
Our community gatherings, workshops, and informal meet-ups are open to everyone — whether you’ve just arrived in Prague or have lived here your whole life. Come meet people, share stories, and find out how you can get involved. See upcoming [events](events-news).

## Become Our Partner and Co-Create With Us
We work with local institutions, NGOs, community centers, and initiatives to build stronger, more connected neighborhoods. If you represent an organization — or are an individual interested in collaboration, sponsorship, or co-creating projects — we’d love to hear from you. 
Together we can design activities, share resources, and strengthen participation across communities. Contact us to explore partnership opportunities.
