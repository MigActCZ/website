RfR is a participatory theatre association and cultural initiative that seeks to strengthen civic engagement, uphold human rights, promote social cohesion, and support global education and peace. It does this by creating spaces for groups experiencing injustice, and their allies, to tap into their power to foster new ways of personal and collective change, through theatre-based methods that spark dialogue and expression.
