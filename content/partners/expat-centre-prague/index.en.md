Prague is open to the world and loves its diversity. That is how the Expat Centre Prague started - as a part of a solid strategy to attract, welcome and engage the city’s international talent. We are a public information service dedicated to helping foreign professionals in all phases of the relocation and settlement process, whether you want to work, study or do business in Prague.
