Join us for a series of participatory meetings aimed at fostering cooperation with representatives from Prague City Hall.

This time we will discuss the city’s integration portal [metropolevsech.eu](https://metropolevsech.eu/en/) (Prague for all). Your feedback will directly influence the website’s contents and design!

We’ll look into the city’s website aimed at its diverse population and discuss the following topics:

- how easy it is to navigate the website
- how can it be improved, enhanced and promoted
- we will test the website together to see how useful, user-friendly and interactive it is

**The meeting will be held in the English and Czech language.**

**The event is organized by&#160;**[MigAct z.s.](http://www.migact.net/)**&#160;and Prague City Hall as a part of the UNITES project.**

Small refreshments will be provided.
