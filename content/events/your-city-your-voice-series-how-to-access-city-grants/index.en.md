Are you an individual or small organization with a big idea, but no money to make it happen? Have you considered applying for grants and public funds? MigAct and Prague City Hall have you covered!

At this event, Prague City Hall representatives will tell you all about the available grants for the integration of foreigners in the City of Prague, explain the eligibility criteria, and walk you step-by-step through the application process. This is a great opportunity to hear from insiders, ask questions, and make friends with the funding world.
