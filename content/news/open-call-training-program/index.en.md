In March, April and May 2025 MigAct is organizing its inaugural Training Program for Community Organizers. [Our program](Open Call-MigAct-10-pages.pdf) is designed to train and support local community organizers living in Prague who have ideas that promote intercultural openness, connect communities, and support active citizenship or socially beneficial goals (e.g., environmental protection, support of vulnerable groups, etc.).

The program will equip participants with essential skills and knowledge to bring their ideas to life. It also aims to foster a vibrant network of like-minded individuals who can collaborate and support one another in making a positive impact. Participants will receive training on essential topics such as community organizing, fundraising, and intercultural communication. These sessions will foster peer-to-peer learning, allowing
participants to share experiences and build networks with other community organizers.
