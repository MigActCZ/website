In a time of growing polarization, many conversations leave us feeling unheard, disconnected, or divided. We speak to argue, persuade, or solve problems, but too rarely to truly listen and connect with each other. Meaningful dialogue creates something different: a space for expanding our empathy, trust, and connection with others and with ourselves, where democracy can be practiced, not just discussed.

MigAct invites facilitators, trainers, civic educators, and community organizers to join a two-day, in-person practical training on meaningful democratic dialogue. Through hands-on practice with the Democracy Dialogues — [DEMOS methodology](https://democracydialogues.eu) developed by the Croatian organization [HERMES](https://hermes.hr), participants will build the skills to foster inclusive, respectful, and transformative conversations.

This training is for those who work with communities and want to strengthen their ability to bring people together, bridge differences, and create spaces where every voice can be heard.
