Project Activities
Educational Program for Community Leaders 
An educational program for individuals who are already active in Prague – for example, those who initiate and lead community activities, are engaged in their neighborhoods, and are interested in developing their civic skills and leadership.
Upon successful completion of the program, participants will receive mini-grants to organize integration activities on selected topics, aimed at connecting diverse residents of Prague.
Community events
A total of 5 events will be held. The topics and formats of these gatherings will be tailored to the needs of the target group. These may include networking events, participatory meetings with local municipal districts, or awareness-raising workshops.
Evaluation
This activity focuses on assessing the project’s impact on the target group.

Project Duration: April 1, 2025 – December 31, 2025

The project is implemented with financial support from the City of Prague.
