As part of the project, we will prepare and implement a crowdfunding campaign focused on raising funds for the training and capacity building of local community leaders – individuals who are active in neighborhood/local activities within the city of Prague. We will primarily target active individuals with a migration background. The selected project participants will undergo training aimed at strengthening their civic competencies and will organize local meetings on selected topics in their areas.

The project was supported by the OSF Foundation through the Stronger Roots program, which is funded by the European Union under the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) program. The Stronger Roots program strengthens the resilience and stability of nonprofit organizations and enhances their connection with the public.
