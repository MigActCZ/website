Led by [Eurocities](https://eurocities.eu/latest/cities-rally-for-integration/), UNITES (UrbaN InTEgration Strategies through co-design) trains and accompanies local authorities to co-design integration strategies with other stakeholders and migrants.

MigAct has been a part of the UNITES project from its beginning. In collaboration with Prague City Hall, we strategically devised and executed a number of participatory workshops, each geared towards fostering stronger collaboration between Prague City Hall and residents with migration backgrounds.

The International conference [Empowering Civic Engagement in a Diverse Society](https://youtu.be/0XqstWapS5M), which took place on 21.09.2023 in Prague was co-financed within the UNITES project. It included a panel discussion  – Engaging migrants in local communities and in co-designing integration strategies – perspectives of European partners in the UNITES project.
