Our focus in this project will be on continually refining the MigAct strategic plan through a series of participatory meetings involving the MigAct core team and MigAct community. These sessions will dive deep into MigAct’s vision, mission, and goals, fostering collaborative dialogue to develop our theory of change and optimize our strategic objectives. Regular participatory meetings with MigAct community will ensure broad stakeholder engagement and input. The activity will culminate in a public presentation of the strategic plan combined with a networking event, demonstrating MigAct’s commitment to transparency and community involvement.
