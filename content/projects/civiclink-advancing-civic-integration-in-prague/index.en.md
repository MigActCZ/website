One of our key priorities for the coming years is to continue building a vibrant and engaged community where people connect, share knowledge, and support one another in strengthening their civic and political presence within Czech society. In the framework of this cooperation with EPIM we would like to expand and strengthen the MigAct community while providing continuous support for the civic and political participation of Prague residents with migration backgrounds.

**Highlights and what we are working on:**

2nd run of Community Organizers Training Program – Spring 2026.
Commnity and networking events.
Support for capacity for civic and community participation at the local level in selected Prague districts.
Revision of our strategic plan for the next period of 2027-2028.

The project is carried out with financial support from EPIM – European Philantropic Initiative for Migration.
