This project aims to identify good examples of how residents with migrant backgrounds can become involved in local civic life in Prague 7. It will begin with research, followed by community meetings where people can work together to find helpful ideas and tools.

The project also supports the long-term and natural involvement of people with migrant backgrounds in local society and decision-making. This will start with a series of participatory community meetings that offer space for open dialogue, sharing experiences, and finding practical solutions together.
