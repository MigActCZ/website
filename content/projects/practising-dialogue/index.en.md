This project promotes inclusive civic participation in Prague and Zagreb by introducing structured dialogue and innovative civic education methods.

### **What we’re working on**

**Training of Local Facilitators (Prague, Czechia)**
 A practical training program will equip a diverse group of local facilitators — civil society actors, educators, and community leaders — with the skills and tools to implement structured dialogue using the DEMOS Dialogue method.

**Open call in February 2026 — don’t miss it!**

**Community Dialogue Sessions**
Trained facilitators will organize structured dialogue sessions on locally relevant topics such as inclusion, civic participation, and trust in public institutions. Each session will bring together residents from diverse social and migration backgrounds to exchange perspectives, identify shared challenges, and co-create solutions.
