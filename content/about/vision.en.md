## Vision and Mission

MigAct envisions a Prague where individuals from all backgrounds— including those with migration experiences— can fully participate in civic life and decision-making processes to foster a society where all voices are heard.

MigAct brings together diverse individuals, communities, and organizations to inspire collaboration and civic engagement. By creating spaces for knowledge sharing, capacity building, and mutual support, we amplify voices across communities and foster active participation in society.
