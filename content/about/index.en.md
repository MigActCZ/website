## Bringing People Together
At MigAct, we believe everyone has a voice that deserves to be heard. We connect people, communities, and organizations to create spaces where knowledge, ideas, and experiences can be shared — making it easier for everyone, whether you’re from a migration background or Czech-born, to take part in civic life.

## What We Do
We organize community gatherings, workshops, and events, provide multilingual resources, and support local initiatives. Our goal is simple: reduce barriers, build connections, and empower residents to actively shape their neighborhoods and society.

## Our Approach
Our work is guided by our Theory of Change — a framework that explains how our activities, resources, and partnerships create meaningful, lasting impact for communities in Prague.

## Our Story
Born out of InBáze z.s. 's long-standing work with migrants in Prague, MigAct officially launched in November 2022. Since then, we’ve grown into a vibrant, community-driven association working toward an inclusive, accessible civil society for all. You can read more in our Annual Reports.

## Our Donors and Partners
MigAct’s work is made possible thanks to the support, trust, and collaboration of our donors, partners, and community allies. Together, we co-create projects, share knowledge, and strengthen opportunities for civic participation across Prague.

We are deeply grateful to all individuals and organizations who stand with us — from long-term collaborators to those who contribute through expertise, resources, or volunteer time. Each partnership helps us take one step closer to a more inclusive and connected society.
