## Bringing People Together
MigAct envisions a Prague where individuals from all backgrounds— including those with migration experiences— can fully participate in civic life and decision-making processes to foster a society where all voices are heard.

## What We Do
MigAct supports individuals and organizations to engage in civic life in Prague by providing resources, building capacities, and creating networks to connect people and institutions. Read more here: What we do and [Projects](projects).

## Our Approach
Our work is guided by our Theory of Change — a framework that explains how our activities, resources, and partnerships create meaningful, lasting impact for communities in Prague.

## Our Story
Born out of InBáze’s long-standing work with migrants in Prague, MigAct officially launched in November 2022. Since then, we’ve grown into a vibrant, community-driven association working toward an inclusive, accessible civil society for all. You can read more in our Annual Reports below.

## Our Donors and Partners
MigAct’s work is made possible thanks to the support, trust, and collaboration of our donors, partners, and community allies. Together, we co-create projects, share knowledge, and strengthen opportunities for civic participation across Prague.

We are deeply grateful to all individuals and organizations who stand with us — from long-term collaborators to those who contribute through expertise, resources, or volunteer time. Each partnership helps us take one step closer to a more inclusive and connected society.
