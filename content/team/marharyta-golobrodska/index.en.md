##### Rita originally connected with MigAct through one of the meetings in Prague Town Hall — while searching for ways to influence the city she lives in as a foreigner without the right to vote. She immediately fell in love with the passion of the small MigAct team aiming for the big impact. She stayed in touch and participated in the Community Organizers training in 2025. As a Ukrainian with a background in journalism, who’s lived in Czechia for 12 years, Rita believes that grassroots initiatives matter for an inclusive society, so she joined the MigAct team to help support civic engagement of foreigners and locals — for a better place to live.
