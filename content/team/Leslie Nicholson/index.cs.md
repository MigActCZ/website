I am a co-founder of MigAct and current Board member. I oversee volunteer coordination and member relations. I am a community networker. I enjoy fostering and nurturing connections in my community. I am also the current co-VP of the International Women's Association of Prague. I bring an extensive knowledge of volunteering recruitment and management. I believe volunteering plays a crucial role in creating positive social impact and addressing community needs. When not working, you will find me singing or directing my choir, an International Women's Choir, spending time with my dogs, Bo & Toby, or traveling with my husband Mike.
