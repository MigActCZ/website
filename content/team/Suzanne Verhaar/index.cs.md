I have joined MigAct to help spread its important message: our society thrives when individuals with migration backgrounds actively participate in civil life and are recognized for the wealth of knowledge, experience, and energy they contribute. When I arrived in Prague, bringing a background in Russian Studies, Political Science, and a decade-long career in Railway Management, I discovered not only the joy but also the necessity of active civic engagement. This journey has profoundly enriched me, allowing me to grow as a person and find stability in an uncertain world. I hope to inspire others to explore these opportunities and connect with the wider global community. I am a freelancer working at the intersection of business administration, project management, and social development. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, cycling, exploring new languages, and diving into historical studies and novels.
